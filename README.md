## Data Set
The [analytical data set](https://github.com/rwerner-upenn/Characteristics-and-Quality-of-US-Nursing-Homes--With-Residents-Infected-With-COVID-19/blob/master/covid_nh_final.dta) is in **.dta (Stata data set)** format.  

## Code
The analytical data set can be re-created using the [SAS code](https://github.com/rwerner-upenn/Characteristics-and-Quality-of-US-Nursing-Homes--With-Residents-Infected-With-COVID-19/blob/master/NH_with_COVID_Data_Set_Creation_Public_Use.sas) in the repository. I recommend to run the code in **SAS 9.4** version. The data sets listed in the **Data Sources** section are required for re-creating the analytical data set.  

The table and descriptive statistics in the article were created using the [Stata code](https://github.com/rwerner-upenn/Characteristics-and-Quality-of-US-Nursing-Homes--With-Residents-Infected-With-COVID-19/blob/master/NH_with_COVID_Analysis_Public_Use.do) in the repository.
